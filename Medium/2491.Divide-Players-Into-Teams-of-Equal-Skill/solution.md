# Intuition
The problem involves pairing players based on their skill levels and maximizing team chemistry. My first thought is to sort the players by their skill levels, then pair the weakest with the strongest to balance teams. By ensuring that each pair has the same total skill, we can maintain fairness across teams while calculating their chemistry.

# Approach
1. **Sort the skill array**: Sorting allows us to easily form pairs by selecting the lowest and highest-skilled players.
2. **Determine the target team skill**: The sum of the first and last playerâ€™s skills will serve as the target for each pair, which must be the same for all teams.
3. **Two-pointer technique**: Use two pointers (`l` and `r`) to iterate from the start and end of the sorted array. For each pair:
   - Check if the sum of the current pair matches the target skill.
   - If any pair doesn't match, return `-1` (invalid configuration).
   - If it matches, calculate the team chemistry by multiplying the skills of the paired players and add it to the total chemistry.
4. **Return the total chemistry**: Once all pairs are processed, return the total chemistry.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:  
  The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is $O(n \log n)$, where `n` is the number of players. The two-pointer technique runs in $O(n)$, so the overall time complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

- Space complexity:  
  The space complexity is $$O(1)$$, since we only use a few extra variables (pointers, counters) and do not require additional data structures.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public long dividePlayers(int[] skill) {
        Arrays.sort(skill);
        int N = skill.length;
        int teamSkill = skill[0] + skill[N-1];
        long totalChemistry = 0;
        int l = 0, r = N - 1;

        while (l < r) {
            if (skill[l] + skill[r] != teamSkill) {
                return -1; 
            }
            totalChemistry += (long) skill[l] * skill[r];  
            l++;
            r--;
        }
        
        return totalChemistry;
    }
}
```
