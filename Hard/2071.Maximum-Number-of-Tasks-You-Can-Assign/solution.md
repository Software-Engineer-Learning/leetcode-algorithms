# Intuition
The problem requires finding the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned to workers, considering a limited number of pills that boost workers' strength. Intuitively, we need to match the hardest tasks with the strongest workers and use pills effectively to balance task-worker mismatches. A binary search approach can help efficiently determine the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.

# Approach
1. **Sort the tasks and workers:** Sorting helps in comparing the most difficult tasks with the strongest available workers.
2. **Binary search on task count:** We perform a binary search to find the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned to workers.
3. **Use a helper function (`canComplete`) to check feasibility:** For each midpoint in the binary search, check if it's possible to assign `mid` tasks by:
   - Matching workers with tasks where workers are strong enough.
   - Using pills strategically to boost workers' strength when necessary.
4. **Deque to track worker assignment:** A deque helps to efficiently match workers to tasks based on their strength and the need for pills.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:  
  Sorting both arrays takes $O(n \log n)$. The binary search involves checking each potential task count, and the `canComplete` function iterates over the tasks, resulting in $$O(n \log n)$$ time complexity overall.

- Space complexity:  
  The space complexity is $O(n)$ due to the deque used for tracking the workers.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxTaskAssign(int[] tasks, int[] workers, int pills, int strength) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks);
        Arrays.sort(workers);
        int l = 0;
        int h = Math.min(tasks.length, workers.length);
        while (l < h) {
            int mid = (l + h + 1) / 2;
            if (canComplete(tasks, workers, pills, strength, mid)) {
                l = mid;
            } else {
                h = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }

    private boolean canComplete(int[] tasks, int[] workers, int pills, int strength, int mid) {
        Deque<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int j = workers.length - 1;
        for (int i = mid - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (j >= workers.length - mid && (workers[j] >= tasks[i] || workers[j] + strength >= tasks[i])) {
                queue.addFirst(workers[j]);
                j--;
            }

            if (queue.isEmpty()) {
                return false;
            }
            if (queue.getLast() >= tasks[i]) {
                queue.pollLast();
            } else if (pills <= 0) {
                return false;
            } else {
                queue.pollFirst();
                pills--;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
